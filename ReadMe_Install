I have choosen a tiny computer, but not a Raspi.
32 GB RAM seems the minimum in my mind. This is my choice.
For the price, the offer with this filter is mainly coming with Windows OS.
I have installed with Windows 11.

Perhaps you want to change and reduce one of these details: it's up to you.

 1. I have installed Windows 11 after I receive the machine.
 2. I have installed a VNC-Server on it. Check your favourite software for this and install it. I have choose TightVNC software.
 3. Please note at this step what is the structure of your hard drive: you need less than 230 GB for space and an additionnal space as 120 GB (machine with 500 GB is a minimum).
 4. I have installed Podman Desktop for Windows (by his editor: Red Hat, leader in 2024 for the Gartner® Magic Quadrant™).
 5. I have activated Linux Subsystems in Windows then I have installed WSL\Debian.
 6. Start Podman Desktop, Start PowerShell and start WSL: set the settings is starting now! If you don't have enough space, you can encounter some issues. It is hard to detect them and correct them.
 7. When you have set correctly everything, go to WSL.
 8. WSL[user_wsl]> sudo su - root
 9. If not working, try direct connexion: WSL[user]> su - root
10. Add this alias (refer to document for more informations) WSL[root]> echo "alias podmanr=podman --remote " >> ~/.bashrc
11. WSL[root]> podmanr ps -a
12. WSL[root]> cd /home/[user_wsl]/
13. WSL[root]> mkdir comet; chown [user_wsl]:[user_wsl] comet; chmod 755 comet
14. WSL[root]> touch Dockerfile; chown [user_wsl]:[user_wsl] Dockerfile; chmod 755 Dockerfile
15. (Download and crash the local file with the Dockerfile from this Project) OR (copy paste text from my online file to local file)
16. Please update informations, set user and passwords as you want inside the file. Recommanded: leave passwords as it is. But once installed, change them.
17. Start Build & then Run ! (report to the Dockerfile document, with instructions inside)
18. Start to use Comet, your container ready for so many ways! Let's go for your Journey into the Milkyway Galaxy!
