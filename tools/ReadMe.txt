PROJECT: Define it
Goal: To share my journey in a cybersecurity view. I start it, so I have a long road to follow.
Action: Write my dairy on this topic. I can share with anyone: it can help if anyone is losing his way.
This document is shared in the mind of making understand where I'm with cybersecurity job.

SETP 1: First Contact with Cybersecurity Domain
Goal: Discover, Learn, Listen, Start a cybersecurity journey.
Action: To learn in self-study with courses from Internet (Youtube, Udemy, etc)

SET 1 BACKGROUND (BG): Technological Monitoring
Goal: A continuous learning, listen news from any source about hacks.
Action: From Step 1, I had a tiny list to use here. Websites and news from anywhere could provide any information.

Step 2: First Contact with labs
Goal: Learn with CTF websites. They are half lessons, half practices.
Action: Discover Labs and understand how to use them.

Step 2 BG: Get informations about how to validate the work done
Goal: Understand the Final Goal with Certifications. Start to work even more my mind with documents and explanations.
Action: A hard goal is OSCP. Understand what is expected and start to collect informations and read feedbacks from former candidates.

Step 3: Tools World
Goal: Forge a personnal Tool.
Action: Kali is nice for OSCP but the best is to have an efficient tool, which is very flexible.
Kali is a ready-distro and perfefct to learn as a CD-Live distro. But a VM could be very slow with this way.
This step is perfect to understand how it's work. More I understand detail, more I grow up.
After a start with VM and after watching courses for differences between VM and Containers, I choose this last option.
I start with Docker, very famous for this scope. But I like to be free: an open-source tool should be better, mainly for any pro licence with a price.

Step 3 BG: Improve the Tool
Goal: To know perfectly how to use a tool is very important. If you know your tool, you know how to change it fast in order to match any situation.
Action: Prepare the tool with a ready-base, which can be up to date easily. This tool could be shared with anyone needs it (this site!!!).

Step 4: Back to CTF
Goal: With the Tool, learn different approches in order to solve a maximum of labs. Make Experiences.
Action: When I create my own Tool, I was facing issues and I used my usual skills to solve each blocking point. It was not easy with my choice of structure. 
But one of the lesson from OSCP which is common from so many attackers, it's to be in a try hard mode.
With few informations, try to catch only any element you really need. But how to know this? Analysis.

Step 5: Budget and Real Life
Goal: This certification has a cost. It's important to prepare this and plan the journey.
Action: Start the preparation and plan the money. It's important to be ready when the budget part will be achieved.
Some will need 3 months. But others could plan this for a year.

Step 6: The Test.
Goal: success the exam. What Else?
Action: As a world contest, be relax and ready for the Day D. Easy to write, Hard to Live. As a sport contest, have a great preparation.
Know yourself: You will know if you need a coach, if you need sport for your health, mental health included...
Read Feedbacks and grow up with advices from others. Don't learn courses. Understand lessons.

- With Youtube, I learn a tool shared: KALI
- I download it as an ISO and I used VirtualBox to use it
- With Youtube, I read this way is not recommanded because of the loosing power mainly for a case with calculations needed by some programs.
- I start to learn Docker: I need also it for another topic, as a customer uses it.
- If a solution is available in order to not have any licence, and valid in any case... it's better. Not easier, but the goal is to have the best flexibility. Hi, Podman!
- With this Tool, I have prepare this Container: a Debian base (as Kali!) and we add Tools we need. Keep in mind we can have a Tool per Cybersecurity Job.
- Many Jobs needs differents modes: a forensic or cryptologists needs a powerful calculator. An OSINT searcher needs invisibility.
- More than the distro, I set my focus on list of programs. As analyse this: https://www.kali.org/tools/all-tools/
- I start to read feedbacks from former candidates: as documents published in GitHub. They shared their own minimum list they have used during the Test.

#####################################################################################################
- Add a licence, as Open Common Licence (Creative Common Licences) => done (cc by sa)
- Finish to test the package: actually 2 services are validated on a total of 3 => after an OS update, 3 on 3 are validated and functionnal! => done
- Prepare the Package and depose it in Github: it will be the main file & Tips files (I said: I wanted something easy!) => done!
- Add a feature VPN/Tunnel in order to secure VNC/RDP connexion
