WELCOME TO THE CARIBBEANS !

Here it's my Project, and inside this Project, you can find this Software: COMET
COMET is a debian-based environment inside a container.
It will be used for ethical hacking, but also for so many ways: why not build a stream-container? Or a Musical server, with tools dedicated? Graphical server? Gaming server as a Minecraft server? And so on...!

You find here:
- a "EULA_Comet.txt" File with the legal warnings as usuel for many softwares (mainly to avoid ugly people who are searching the bad!)
- a "ReadMe" File is set on "Tools" directory and this document explains what is this project: in a hand, my needs & all the big questions, and in the other hand the solution which is the Answer, with This Project.
- a "ReadMe_Install" file with steps for installation => any issue could provide from an error during installation. It's an important Step to be carreful with.
- a main File for the Project: a Dockerfile (available mainly to be used also by Podman as a ContainerFile) to use for an ethical hacking tool [When I will achieved Validation phase! Keep in Touch, it will be soon]
- wallpapers: to use easily customised pictures as personnal backgrounds: I pick free pictures, and add on one the Debian Logo and I create a Comet Logo for the second, from free pictures too (use COPY if you want your own file or change URL: you catch project and change for your own usage)
- tools: some files to helps you with some issues I was facing!
   - bin: scripts I have used. You can download them if you need a ready-file but you can create your own with informations from Tips-Files
   - bintmp: it's the target for the main using from me in order to swap files from a machine to another (goal: validation)

COMET, 3 ways to access:
- VNC throught a VNC Client
- noVNC throught a browser
- RDP throught a Windows Computer

The Tool can be used in RDP (for easiest way) to use on hack-boxes (next update will be to add a VPN feature).
